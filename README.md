To take advantage of SpaCy's corpora, you need to load a pre-trained model and use it to process text. SpaCy provides
several pre-trained models that include corpora for various languages. Here is an example of how to use SpaCy's English
model to process text and extract information such as named entities, parts of speech, and more:

1. Install SpaCy and download the pre-trained model:
   ```sh
   pip install spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
   ```

2. Use the pre-trained model in your code:
   ```python
   import spacy

   # Load the pre-trained model
   nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

   # Process a text
   text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
   doc = nlp(text)

   # Extract named entities
   for ent in doc.ents:
       print(ent.text, ent.label_)

   # Extract parts of speech
   for token in doc:
       print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)
   ```

This code will load the SpaCy model, process the text, and print out the named entities and parts of speech. You can use
similar methods to extract other linguistic features provided by SpaCy's corpora.
